**Report: NESTEDCV in Time Series**

**Introduction:**
The following report presents a comprehensive time series analysis of Gazoza sales in Greece using historical data. The analysis encompasses data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, trend identification, and forecasting for the upcoming year.

**1. Data Cleaning:**
The dataset provided includes sales records of various drink brands across different cities in Greece. However, for this analysis, we focused solely on the Gazoza brand. Data cleaning involved handling missing values, ensuring data consistency, and preparing the dataset for analysis.

**2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
EDA was performed to understand the underlying patterns and trends in Gazoza sales over time. We visualized sales trends, examined relationships between variables, and identified potential outliers.

**3. Stationarity Analysis:**
A crucial step in time series analysis is to determine whether the data is stationary or not. Stationarity implies that the statistical properties of the data, such as mean and variance, remain constant over time. We conducted a Dickey-Fuller test to assess stationarity. The test indicated that the data is not stationary; hence, further preprocessing was required.

**4. Preprocessing:**
To achieve stationarity, we performed logarithmic transformation of the sales data. Additionally, we applied differencing to remove trend and seasonality components, resulting in a stationary time series.

**5. Decomposition:**
Decomposition of the time series into its trend, seasonal, and residual components provided insights into the underlying patterns. This facilitated better understanding of the data dynamics and aided in forecasting.

**6. Forecasting:**
We employed the Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) model for forecasting future sales of Gazoza in Greece. The model was trained on the transformed data and used to predict sales for the upcoming year (2018). Confidence intervals were calculated to assess the uncertainty in the forecasts.

**7. Results:**
The ARIMA model produced forecasts for Gazoza sales in 2018, along with corresponding confidence intervals. The forecasted values were compared against actual test data from 2018 to evaluate the model's performance.
